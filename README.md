# SQL-challenge

Task
In this project, I was asked to completee a research project regarding the employees that worked with a company from the 1980s and 1990s. With only six csv files remaining as data from those former employees era, in which I had to create an ERD to visualize the data and then used postgreSQL to plot the tables and compile the data.

I first created the ERD by using the webtool provided.

Data Engineering
I used the data from the csv files to create tables for each file respectively. Once I analyzed the information in the csv I made sure I used the appropriate data type for each column. Once I had appropriated labeled everything, including the use of Primary and Foreign keys, Imported the data into the tables created in postgreSQL. The next step was to provide some answers based on analysis of that data. The questions I provided answers for are below.
